    "# Read Only\n",
    "\n",
    "Pineapple includes the \"read-only\" notebook extension built-in. This extension allows you to mark cells as read-only. When a cell is marked read-only it cannot be changed until the read-only is turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "Marking cells as read-only doesn't actually make them permanent or unchangeable. The point is to mark which parts of a notebook are intended to be edited and which parts are intended to be left alone. For example, a notebook could be used to represent an assignment in a class. Introduction cells could be marked read-only. Examples that are intended to be changed for experimentation could not be marked read-only. Description of the problem to be solved could be marked read-only."

    "Cells that are marked read-only cannot be edited. Markdown cells that are rendered cannot be changed to edit mode by double-clicking. Code cells cannot be edited but can be executed. Cells that are read-only cannot be deleted or moved.\n",

    "## Appearance\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells that are read-only will usually have a distinct visual element. The precise appearance depends on the theme chosen. The \"None\" theme has no markings for read-only cells. \"Light\", \"Dark\", and \"Borlandia\" use a stripe pattern to mark code cells that are read-only. In \"Light\" and \"Dark\", rendered Markdown cells show the stripe pattern to indicate read-only when the cell is selected. The \"Borlandia\" theme uses different colored selection boxes to indicate when rendered Markdown cells are read-only.\n",
